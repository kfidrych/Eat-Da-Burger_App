# Eat-Da-Burger_App

## About Eat-Da_Burger

Eat-Da-Burger is a one page web app for creating a database of available burgers to be consumed. Users can then consume the burgers and make them unavailable for others. Anyone can create new burgers.

This app uses MySQL, Node, Express and Handlebars as well as a unique ORM.

## Instructions

Eat-Da-Burger is very easy to use. To set up the app:

* Firstly, after setting up the file structure, run `npm install` in the terminal to download the required modules.

* Make sure the config file is set up to your local server and database.

* Run `mysql -u root -p` to login.

* With the `mysql>` command line tool running, enter the command `source schema.sql` then `source seeds.sql` then `exit`.

* You should now be all set to start the server and go to the localhost path in the browser to run the app!

Within the app users can input new Burgers by name and eat them as they like! Have Fun!
